      You can dine with a view on the 1st floor or indulge at the Michelin-starred Le Jules Verne
      restaurant on the 2nd floor. At the exhilarating height of 276 meters, the top floor offers a
      sweeping outlook over the city of Paris and beyond. Vistas extend as far as 70 kilometers on a
      clear day.

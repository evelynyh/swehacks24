    <h3>
      Rocamadour is suspended on a sheer limestone cliff as if
       providing a medium for spiritual wonders. In the 11th century, this pilgrimage destination
       was the third most important in Christendom after Jerusalem and Rome.
      </h3>

      <h3>
      The village has seven ancient sanctuaries, but pilgrims flock to the Chapelle Notre-Dame
      (Chapelle Miraculeuse), which possesses the venerated Black Virgin (Notre-Dame de Rocamadour).
      This precious Virgin Mary figure was carved from walnut wood that naturally darkened over the
      centuries and is associated with miracles.

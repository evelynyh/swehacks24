    <h3>
      Off the Normandy coast, Mont Saint-Michel is one of France's most
      striking landmarks. This "Pyramid of the Seas" is a mystical sight,
      perched 80 meters above the bay and surrounded by imposing defensive
      walls and bastions.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        Since it was built in the 11th century, the Abbey Church has
        been an important Christian pilgrimage destination, known as
        "The Heavenly Jerusalem." Modern-day pilgrims are still inspired by
        Mont Saint-Michel and continue the tradition of crossing the bay by
        foot as it was done in the Middle Ages.

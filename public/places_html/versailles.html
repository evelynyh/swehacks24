    <h3>
      The Château de Versailles or Palace of Versailles
      is the palace of Louis XIV (the "Sun King"), Louis XV, and Louis XVI.
      The most spectacular space in the palace is the Hall of Mirrors, where courtiers
      waited for an audience with His Majesty. This dazzling gallery sparkles with sunlight
       that enters through the windows and is reflected off hundreds of ornamental mirrors,
       while dozens of glittering chandeliers and gilded details make the overall impression
       even more marvelous.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        Versailles is equally renowned for Les Jardins, formal French gardens featuring
        decorative pools, perfectly trimmed shrubbery, numerous statues, and magnificent
        fountains. The gardens were created in the 17th century by renowned landscape
        designer André Le Nôtre and are surrounded by 800 hectares of lush parkland.

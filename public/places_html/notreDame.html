    <h3>
      The Notre Dame Cathedral is a marvel of Gothic architecture, renowned for
       its 12th- and 13th-century stained-glass windows. Covering 2,500 square meters,
       the brilliant windows allow colorful light to filter into the vast nave, creating
       an ethereal effect. The intricately detailed windows reveal the incredible craftsmanship
       in depicting biblical stories.

        On the third Saturday of September, the city of Chartres presents Chartres en Lumières
        (Festival of Light) during European Heritage Days. The festival includes street art, music,
        and guided tours. During this annual event, the Chartres Cathedral dazzles crowds with its
         colorful multimedia show featuring illuminations and sound. The illumination show also takes
         place at the cathedral in July and August every evening after 10pm.
